                You and I both know that being together physically poses a problem, although it is only a minor one.</P>
                <P class="content" >Even though we have never even seen each other and looked each other in the eye and expressed ourselves the way we do on text. </P>
                <p class="content"> Even if I can't be with you this valentine or on any day.</p>
                <p class="content"> It doesn't phase me, it doesn't phase us.</p>
               <p class="content"> What does phase me is that there isn't a lot I can do for you this valentines,</p>
               <p class="content"> Or a lot I can offer you at the current moment.</p>
               <p class="content"> And I want to give you everything that I can give, anything that you want.</p>
               <br>
               <p class="content"> I don't have a lot of options as to how I can express the way that I feel about you, but the least I could do is put in effort to atleast let you know that I think of you.</p>
               <p class="content"> For my muse I have all the effort and energy in the world.</p>
               <p class="content"> Just by you being you, you give me peace and hope.</p>
               <p class="content"> A peaceful today, and a hopefull tomorrow.</p>
